# RealtimeChartIdea
Playing with dotnetcore http controller (c#) &amp; chartjs in unison.

Currently the chart redraws in place with different sets of data.

Cursory TODOs:

- Try manipulating chart data without a full redraw - seems a bit amateur :)
- Connec to a DataProvider, presumably sql or whatever.
- Temporarily cache data on the controller to avoid over-querying the dataprovider.
